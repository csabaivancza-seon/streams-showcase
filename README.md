# Streams versus generators versus loops
## Comparing 

There're free files for showcasing:
- `npm run for` `forloop.js`: opens a file that contains 1M records and processes it.
- `npm run stream` `stream.js` opens a file that contains 1M records and processes it.
- `npm run generator` `generator.js`: opens a file that contains 1M records and processes it.

## Use case in web development

- `frontend` folder is a `lit-element` project for rendering frontend
- `backend` folder is a simple `express` project
